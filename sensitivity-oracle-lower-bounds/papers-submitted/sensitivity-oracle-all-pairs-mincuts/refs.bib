abstract={It is known that all minimum cuts in a networkN can be embedded in a cactus whose size is bounded by a linear function of the number of vertices inN, such that any minimum cut ofN can be easily obtained as a minimum cut of the cactus. However, such a representation for a given network is not unique. We introduce two canonical forms of cactus representation for the minimum cuts and show their uniqueness. These cacti contain at most twice as many vertices asN.},
