\begin{abstract}
% Let $G=(V,E)$ be an undirected unweighted graph on $n$ vertices and $m$ edges. We address the problem of fault-tolerant data structure for all-pairs mincuts in $G$ defined as follows.

% Build a compact data structure that, on receiving a pair of vertices $s,t\in V$ and any edge $(x,y)$ as query, can efficiently report the value of the mincut between $s$ and $t$ upon failure of the edge $(x,y)$.

% To the best of our knowledge, there exists no data structure for this problem which takes $o(mn)$ space and a non-trivial query time. We present two compact data structures for this problem.
% \begin{enumerate}
% \item Our first data structure guarantees ${\cal O}(1)$ query time. The space occupied by this data structure is ${\cal O}(n^2)$ which matches the worst-case size of a graph on $n$ vertices.
% \item
% Our second data structure takes ${\cal O}(m)$ space which 
% % is optimal
% matches the size of the graph. The query time is ${\cal O}(\min(m,n c_{s,t}))$ where $c_{s,t}$ is the value of the mincut between $s$ and $t$ in $G$. The query time guaranteed by our data structure is faster by a factor of $\Omega(\min(m^{1/3},\sqrt{n}))$ compared to the best known deterministic algorithm \cite{DBLP:conf/focs/GoldbergR97a,DBLP:conf/stoc/KargerL98,DBLP:journals/corr/abs-2003-08929} to compute a $(s,t)$-mincut.
% \end{enumerate}


% Both these data structures can also report the resulting $(s,t)$-mincut incorporating the failure in ${\cal O}(\min(m,n c_{s,t}))$ time.

Let $G=(V,E)$ be an undirected unweighted graph on $n$ vertices and $m$ edges. We address the problem of sensitivity oracle for all-pairs mincuts in $G$ defined as follows.

Build a compact data structure that, on receiving a pair of vertices $s,t\in V$ and failure (or insertion) of any edge as query, can efficiently report the mincut between $s$ and $t$ after the failure (or the insertion).

To the best of our knowledge, there exists no data structure for this problem which takes $o(mn)$ space and a non-trivial query time.
% Recently, Baswana, Gupta, and Knollman \cite{DBLP:conf/esa/BaswanaGK20} gave a data structure that can handle single edge insertion in ${\cal O}(n^2)$ space and ${\cal O}(1)$ query time. 
We present the following results.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Our first data structure occupies ${\cal O}(n^2)$ space and guarantees ${\cal O}(1)$ query time to report the value of resulting $(s,t)$-mincut upon failure (or insertion) of any edge. Moreover, the set of vertices defining a resulting $(s,t)$-mincut after the update can be reported in ${\cal O}(n)$ time which is worst-case optimal.
    % Our data structure also subsumes the previous results of Baswana, Gupta, and Knollman \cite{DBLP:conf/esa/BaswanaGK20} which only handles an edge insertion.
\item
Our second data structure optimizes space at the expense of increased query time. It takes ${\cal O}(m)$ space -- which is also the space taken by $G$. The query time is ${\cal O}(\min(m,n c_{s,t}))$ where $c_{s,t}$ is the value of the mincut between $s$ and $t$ in $G$. This query time is faster by a factor of $\Omega(\min(m^{1/3},\sqrt{n}))$ compared to the best known deterministic algorithm \cite{DBLP:conf/focs/GoldbergR97a,DBLP:conf/stoc/KargerL98,DBLP:journals/corr/abs-2003-08929} to compute a $(s,t)$-mincut from scratch.
