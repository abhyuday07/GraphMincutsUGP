% The abstractpage environment sets up everything on the page except
% the text itself.  The title and other header material are put at the
% top of the page, and the supervisors are listed at the bottom.  A
% new page is begun both before and after.  Of course, an abstract may
% be more than one page itself.  If you need more control over the
% format of the page, you can use the abstract environment, which puts
% the word "Abstract" at the beginning and single spaces its text.

%% You can either \input (*not* \include) your abstract file, or you can put
%% the text of the abstract directly between the \begin{abstractpage} and
%% \end{abstractpage} commands.

% First copy: start a new page, and save the page number.
% Uncomment the next line if you do NOT want a page number on your
% abstract and acknowledgments pages.

\section*{Acknowledgments}

I am deeply indebted to Prof Surender Baswana for allowing me to work with him. I am thankful to him for having regular meetings despite his busy schedule and helping me acquire the necessary perseverance for solving a research problem. I would like to thank Prof Yefim Dinitz and Prof Alek Vainshtein for their seminal work ``The connectivity carcass of a vertex subset in a graph and its incremental maintenance" which appeared in STOC 1994 and subsequently in SIAM Journal of Computing 2000 edition. The paper truly captures the entire anatomy of mincuts and also forms the foundation of our results. Last but not the least, I would like to thank my parents and sister for their incredible and unconditional support in this pandemic.
