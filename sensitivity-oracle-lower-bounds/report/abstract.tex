Let $G=(V,E)$ be an undirected unweighted graph on $n$ vertices and $m$ edges. We address the problem of sensitivity oracle for all-pairs mincuts in $G$ defined as follows.

Build a compact data structure that, on receiving a pair of vertices $s,t\in V$ and insertion/deletion of any edge as query, can efficiently report the value of the mincut between $s$ and $t$ upon the update.

To the best of our knowledge, there exists no data structure for this problem which takes $o(mn)$ space and a non-trivial query time. Recently, Baswana, Gupta, and Knollman \cite{DBLP:conf/esa/BaswanaGK20} gave a data structure that can handle single edge insertion in ${\cal O}(n^2)$ space and ${\cal O}(1)$ query time. We present the following results.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item We present a sensitivity oracle for all-pairs mincuts. Our data structure guarantees ${\cal O}(1)$ query time. The space occupied by this data structure is ${\cal O}(n^2)$ which matches the worst-case size of a graph on $n$ vertices. A resulting $(s,t)$-mincut after edge insertion/deletion can be reported in ${\cal O}(n)$ time which is optimal. Our data structure also subsumes the results of Baswana, Gupta, and Knollman \cite{DBLP:conf/esa/BaswanaGK20}.
    \item We give conditional lower bounds on data structures that can handle dual-deletions (or dual-faults) for a $(s,t)$-mincut. We also give a conditional lower bound on a data structure storing all static $(\{s,u\},\{t,v\})$-mincut values with fixed $s,t \in V$. This implies a conditional lower bound for a generalized flow tree for $2 \times 2$ mincuts, i.e. a data structure that can report the value of static $(\{s,u\},\{t,v\})$-mincut for given vertices $s,t,u,v \in V$.
\end{enumerate}

Some parts of this work have been taken from a recent research of Baswana and Pandey \cite{DBLP:journals/corr/BaswanaP20}, but presented here for sake of continuity.
