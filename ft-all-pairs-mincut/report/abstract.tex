Let $G=(V,E)$ be an undirected unweighted graph on $n$ vertices and $m$ edges. We address the problem of fault-tolerant data structure for all-pairs mincuts in $G$ defined as follows.

Build a compact data structure that, on receiving a pair of vertices $s,t\in V$ and any edge $(x,y)$ as query, can efficiently report the value of the mincut between $s$ and $t$ upon failure of the edge $(x,y)$.

To the best of our knowledge, there exists no data structure for this problem which takes $o(mn)$ space and a non-trivial query time. We present two compact data structures for this problem.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Our first data structure guarantees ${\cal O}(1)$ query time. The space occupied by this data structure is ${\cal O}(n^2)$ which matches the worst-case size of a graph on $n$ vertices.
\item
Our second data structure takes ${\cal O}(m)$ space which 
% is optimal
matches the size of the graph. The query time is ${\cal O}(\min(m,n c_{s,t}))$ where $c_{s,t}$ is the value of the mincut between $s$ and $t$ in $G$. The query time guaranteed by our data structure is faster by a factor of $\Omega(\sqrt{n})$ compared to the best known algorithm \cite{DBLP:conf/focs/GoldbergR97a,DBLP:conf/stoc/KargerL98} to compute a $(s,t)$-mincut.
\end{enumerate}


Both these data structures can also report the resulting $(s,t)$-mincut incorporating the failure in ${\cal O}(\min(m,n c_{s,t}))$ time.
